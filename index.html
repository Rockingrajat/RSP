            It is known by all that, rural areas have very less to offer when it comes to providing children with opportunities that will unleash their capabilities .

            So, we here at RSP, have come up with the idea of  providing JNV entrance coachings to rural underprivileged children.
            <br>
            <b><center>HOW?</center></b><br>
            A selection test is conducted for students of classes 4, 5 and 8 in low facilitated government schools, based on which children are taken in for the coaching.
            RSP volunteers, help the selected set of children prepare for the entrance by holding regular weekend classes for them.
            RSP wants all the students to prepare their best and hence, tests are conducted every alternate Sunday. Special care is taken to evaluate the test results in order to pay personal attention on every child  for better future performance.
            So far, their academic performance has been really well in their respective schools as well as in the tests conducted by RSP.
            RSP is gradually witnessing its hard work paying off.

                <p>Introducing modern advanced technology to traditional classroom settings thereby making the classes interesting than usual for the children.
                    The results being-
                    decline in the absence rate (In fact, children arrive before the volunteers do in class.)

                The RSP team goes from door to door, convincing parents that education is not exclusively for the rich. The aim is to make parents notice the changes in their ward's thinking and behaviour by making them realise the importance of quality education. RSP tries to include the parents at every step of their ward's educational journey. Weekly parent-teacher meets are arranged to discuss about the problems that act as a hindrance in their ward's path towards achieving academic excellence at school level.
                RSP thinks that it is equally important to bring awareness among the parents.

            <p><center> RSP's playschool model is exclusively designed for children who come from families that do not have roofs over their heads.
            Children coming from such backgrounds have no idea about what an ideal childhood is and RSP wishes to provide them with just that.
            WHY PRE PRIMARY EDUCATION?
            pre primary education sets the base on which all other levels of school based academic education stands on. RSP aims at building a strong base for the proper development of these children who deserve as much as any other child.
